# Roadmap

Planned features and enhancements. These specs are designed to guide implementation.

## Phase 3: Browser Automation & AI

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| [Conversion Explorer](/docs/plans/conversion-explorer) | Planned | Navigate booking funnels to find friction |
| [Photo Analysis](/docs/plans/photo-analysis) | Planned | Count and assess property photos |
| [Review Detection](/docs/plans/review-detection) | Planned | Find reviews and trust badges |
| [AI Visual Feedback](/docs/plans/ai-visual-feedback) | Planned | Vision model design analysis |

## Dependencies

These features require:

```bash
# Browserbase for browser automation
BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=
BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=

# AI models for analysis
GEMINI_API_KEY=      # recommended
OPENAI_API_KEY=      # alternative
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=   # alternative
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Review Detection** — Low complexity, high value for trust scoring
2. **Photo Analysis (Standard)** — Photo count, no AI needed
3. **Conversion Explorer** — Requires Stagehand, most complex
4. **AI Visual Feedback** — Premium feature, on-demand
5. **Photo Analysis (Premium)** — AI quality assessment, on-demand
