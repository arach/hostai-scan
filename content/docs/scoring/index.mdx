# Scoring System

## Formula

```
Category Score = max(0, 100 - Σ penalties)
Overall Score = Σ (category_score × weight)
Penalty = severity_base × impact × confidence
```

## Grades

| Score | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| 90-100 | A (Excellent) |
| 80-89 | B (Good) |
| 70-79 | C (Needs Work) |
| 60-69 | D (Poor) |
| 0-59 | F (Critical) |

## Category Weights

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Conversion | 32% |
| Performance | 18% |
| Trust | 18% |
| Content | 14% |
| Analytics | 8% |
| SEO | 7% |
| Security | 3% |

## Severity Bases

| Severity | Base | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Blocker | 35 | No CTA, no HTTPS |
| Major | 18 | Slow LCP, no reviews |
| Minor | 8 | Thin description |
| Trivial | 4 | No video |

## Safety Clamps

| Condition | Max Score |
|-----------|-----------|
| Any conversion blocker | 69 |
| No HTTPS | 59 |
