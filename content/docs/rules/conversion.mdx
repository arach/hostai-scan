# Conversion Rules

Conversion rules are the most important category (35% of overall score). They answer the fundamental question: **Can users actually book a stay?**

## Why Conversion Matters Most

A beautiful, fast website means nothing if guests can't figure out how to book. These rules detect friction in the booking funnel that causes abandonment.

## Rules

### missing_primary_cta

**Primary booking CTA not visible above fold (mobile)**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Blocker |
| Impact | 0.95 |
| Effort | Medium |

Guests arriving on mobile should see a clear booking button without scrolling. If the primary CTA is buried below the fold, many visitors will leave before discovering how to book.

**Fix:** Add a prominent "Book Now" or "Check Availability" button in the hero section, visible without scrolling on mobile.

---

### no_sticky_cta_mobile

**No persistent booking CTA on mobile**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.75 |
| Effort | Medium |

As mobile users scroll through property details, they should always have a booking option visible. A sticky bottom bar or floating button keeps the action accessible.

**Fix:** Add a persistent "Book Now" bar that stays visible as users scroll through property pages.

---

### click_depth_high

**Booking requires too many clicks from home**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major (3-4 clicks) / Blocker (5+ clicks) |
| Impact | 0.75–0.90 |
| Effort | Medium |

Every additional click between landing and booking is an opportunity to lose the guest. The booking flow should be reachable in 3 clicks or fewer.

**Fix:** Streamline navigation. Add direct booking links to property cards. Consider booking widgets directly on listing pages.

---

### missing_cancellation

**Cancellation policy not visible near booking CTA**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.70 |
| Effort | Low |

Guests hesitate to book when cancellation terms are unclear. The policy should be visible before they enter payment details.

**Fix:** Display a brief cancellation summary near booking buttons.

---

### fees_not_visible_early

**Fees and taxes hidden until checkout**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.65 |
| Effort | Medium |

"Drip pricing" frustrates guests. When fees appear only at checkout, it feels deceptive and causes abandonment.

**Fix:** Show the full price breakdown early—ideally on the property page or at the start of booking.

---

### requires_account

**Account creation required to book**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.60 |
| Effort | Medium |

Forcing account creation before booking adds friction. Many guests will abandon rather than create yet another account.

**Fix:** Allow guest checkout. Offer account creation as optional after booking is complete.

---

### no_instant_booking

**No instant booking option (inquiry only)**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Minor |
| Impact | 0.40 |
| Effort | High |

Modern travelers expect to book instantly. Inquiry-only flows introduce uncertainty and delays.

**Fix:** Enable instant booking with real-time availability.

---

### cross_domain_booking

**Booking hands off to third-party domain**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Minor |
| Impact | 0.35 |
| Effort | High |

When booking redirects to a different domain, guests may question legitimacy.

**Fix:** If using a third-party booking engine, embed it on your domain or use a subdomain.

## Impact on Score

Conversion issues have the highest scoring impact. Any conversion **blocker** caps the overall score at 69 (grade D), regardless of how well other areas perform.
