# Performance Rules

Performance rules account for 20% of the overall score. They measure whether the site loads fast enough to retain visitors, especially on mobile.

## Core Web Vitals

Performance rules are based on Google's Core Web Vitals:

| Metric | Measures | Good | Poor |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| LCP | Loading speed | ≤2.5s | >4s |
| CLS | Visual stability | ≤0.1 | >0.25 |
| INP | Responsiveness | ≤200ms | >500ms |
| TBT | Main thread blocking | ≤300ms | >600ms |

## Rules

### mobile_lcp_slow

**Mobile Largest Contentful Paint too slow**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major (>3s) / Blocker (>5s) |
| Impact | 0.70–0.90 |
| Effort | Medium |

LCP measures when the largest visible element finishes loading. Slow LCP means guests stare at incomplete screens.

**Common fixes:**
- Optimize images (compress, use WebP)
- Implement lazy loading
- Use a CDN
- Reduce server response time

### cls_poor

**Cumulative Layout Shift too high**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major (>0.1) / Blocker (>0.25) |
| Impact | 0.55–0.75 |
| Effort | Medium |

CLS measures visual stability—how much the page "jumps" as it loads.

**Common fixes:**
- Set explicit width/height on images
- Reserve space for dynamic content
- Avoid inserting content above existing content

---

### inp_high

**Interaction to Next Paint too slow**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major (>200ms) / Blocker (>500ms) |
| Impact | 0.60–0.80 |
| Effort | High |

INP measures how quickly the page responds to user interactions.

**Common fixes:**
- Break up long JavaScript tasks
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Optimize event handlers

---

### tbt_high

**Total Blocking Time too high**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major (>300ms) / Blocker (>600ms) |
| Impact | 0.55–0.75 |
| Effort | High |

TBT measures how long the main thread is blocked, preventing interaction.

**Common fixes:**
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Remove unused code
- Code-split large bundles

## Revenue Impact

| Issue | Estimated Impact |
|-------|------------------|
| Mobile LCP >5s | -25% mobile conversions |
| Mobile LCP 3–5s | -15% mobile conversions |
