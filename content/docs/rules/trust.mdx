# Trust Rules

Trust rules account for 20% of the overall score. They assess whether the site establishes enough credibility for guests to feel safe booking.

## Why Trust Matters

Guests are deciding whether to trust a stranger with their vacation—and their credit card. Unlike OTAs with built-in trust, direct booking sites must establish credibility independently.

## Rules

### missing_reviews

**No reviews visible on site**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.70 |
| Effort | Medium |

Reviews are the most powerful trust signal. Without them, guests have no way to verify the property matches its description.

**Fix:** Display reviews prominently—import from OTAs, add native reviews, or embed Google reviews.

---

### low_review_count

**Fewer than 5 reviews displayed**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Minor |
| Impact | 0.35 |
| Effort | Low |

Five reviews is the minimum threshold for credibility.

**Fix:** Actively collect reviews from past guests.

---

### stale_reviews

**Most recent review older than 6 months**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Minor |
| Impact | 0.40 |
| Effort | Low |

Old reviews suggest the property may no longer be active.

**Fix:** Follow up with recent guests to request reviews.

---

### missing_identity

**No business name, phone number, or address visible**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.65 |
| Effort | Low |

Anonymous websites are suspicious. Guests want to know who they're dealing with.

**Fix:** Display contact information prominently: phone, address, about page.

---

### no_third_party_badges

**No Airbnb/VRBO/Google review badges**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Minor |
| Impact | 0.30 |
| Effort | Low |

If the property has good ratings on major platforms, displaying those badges transfers trust.

**Fix:** Add platform badges or ratings widgets.
