# Security Rules

Security rules account for 3% of the overall score. They verify that basic security requirements are met.

## Why Security Is Low Weight (But Critical)

Security has low weight because it's table stakes—most sites pass. However, security failures have severe consequences: missing HTTPS caps the maximum score at 59.

## Rules

### no_https

**Site not served over HTTPS**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Blocker |
| Impact | 0.95 |
| Effort | Medium |

HTTPS is mandatory for any site handling personal or payment information.

**Fix:** Enable HTTPS via Let's Encrypt or your hosting provider.

**Score Impact:** Caps overall score at 59 regardless of other performance.

---

### mixed_content

**HTTP assets loaded on HTTPS pages**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Major |
| Impact | 0.50 |
| Effort | Low |

Mixed content occurs when an HTTPS page loads resources over HTTP.

**Fix:** Update all resource URLs to HTTPS.

---

### weak_tls

**SSL/TLS configuration weak**

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Severity | Minor |
| Impact | 0.30 |
| Effort | Medium |

Outdated TLS configurations may support deprecated protocols.

**Fix:** Disable TLS 1.0/1.1, remove weak cipher suites.

## HTTPS Is Non-Negotiable

As of 2026, there is no legitimate reason for a booking site to lack HTTPS:
- Free certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Most hosting providers enable by default
- Browsers actively warn about HTTP sites
